# üß† League of Legends Win Prediction - ML Based Web App

This project is a **Machine Learning-based web application** that predicts the **outcome of a League of Legends game** using champion-player experience and in-game statistics. It leverages live and historical match data to enhance prediction accuracy across various regions.

## üîç Overview

The app utilizes:
- **Gradient Boosting (GBoost)** ML algorithm for win prediction
- **Live match data** fetched using Riot Games API and third-party data providers
- A simple and intuitive **React.js** frontend
- A lightweight **Flask** backend serving the ML model

Due to legal restrictions, the training data (CSV files) are not publicly included in this repository.

## üöÄ Features

- üîÅ **Live Match Prediction** ‚Äì Predict the win probability of an ongoing or upcoming match
- üìä **Region-Based Data** ‚Äì Trained on matches across different regions (e.g., NA, EUW, KR)
- üß† **Champion-Player Experience** ‚Äì Integrates player expertise and role performance
- ‚ö° **Fast & Responsive** ‚Äì Frontend built with React for a seamless user experience

## üì¶ How It Works

1. **Frontend (React):**
   - User inputs a summoner name and region
   - Data is fetched from the backend and presented in an interactive UI

2. **Backend (Flask):**
   - Fetches live or historical match data
   - Preprocesses input for the ML model
   - Returns prediction results

3. **ML Model (GBoost):**
   - Trained on curated match datasets
   - Takes in champion IDs, player stats, and other features to predict win rate

- This project is **educational** and **non-commercial**.
- All data was gathered using the **official Riot API** and permitted third-party tools.
- Training datasets are **not included** due to legal limitations on redistribution.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
